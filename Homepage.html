    <section id="about" class="about-section">
        <h2>About Ozone Depletion</h2>
        <p>Ozone depletion refers to the thinning of the ozone layer, which acts as Earth's shield against harmful UV radiation. Discover how this process occurs, its impact on ecosystems, and global health concerns.</p>
        
           
        <p>Ozone depletion refers to the thinning of the ozone layer, which acts as Earth's shield against harmful UV radiation. This process is primarily caused by human-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS).</p>
        <p>When these substances are released into the atmosphere, they eventually reach the stratosphere, where UV radiation breaks them down, releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone (O3) molecules, leading to ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>The consequences of ozone depletion include increased UV radiation exposure, which can result in higher rates of skin cancer, cataracts, and other health issues, as well as detrimental effects on ecosystems, particularly affecting phytoplankton, which are vital to the marine food web.</p>

    <!-- Future of Ozone Section -->
<section id="future" class="future-section">
    <h2>The Future of the Ozone Layer</h2>
    <p>The future of the ozone layer is cautiously optimistic, thanks to international efforts like the Montreal Protocol, which successfully phased out many ozone-depleting substances (ODS).</p>
    <p>However, challenges remain. Climate change and the increase of certain chemicals can still pose risks to the recovery of the ozone layer. Continued vigilance and action are necessary to ensure its restoration.</p>
    <p>Some key points for the future include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Research:</strong> Ongoing satellite monitoring and research will help us understand the ozone layer's recovery and identify new threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy and Legislation:</strong> Strengthening global policies to prevent the use of harmful substances is crucial for the protection of the ozone layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating the public about ozone depletion and encouraging sustainable practices can drive community action toward ozone protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By working together, we can ensure a healthier ozone layer for future generations.</p>
