Problem Statement

Ozone Monitoring and Environmental Awareness Web App 


Ozone depletion, along with slowly increasing pollution levels, is one of the severe environmental threats coupled with health hazards. This project develops a web application that provides real-time ozone and air quality data to users while educating them on the causes of ozone depletion and tracking their personal environmental impact.

Some of its significant features are:
1)Real-Time Ozone Monitoring: It fetches public APIs-based real-time ozone data as well as air quality and visualizes them using interactive charts.
2)Educational Resources: Inform users about the depletion of ozone and the actions that people can take to minimize their impact on the environment.

Thus, the application will educate and generate awareness regarding saving the earth
